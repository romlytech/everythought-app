          Opting out of email marketing: You can unsubscribe from our marketing
          email list at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the
          emails that we send or by contacting us. You will then be removed from
          the marketing email list — however, we may still communicate with you,
          for example to send you service-related emails that are necessary for
          the administration and use of your account, to respond to service
          requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.

          Controls for do-not-track features
        </h4>
        <p>
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
          applications include a Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or
          setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have
          data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At
          this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
          implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not
          currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
          automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a
          standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
          future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of
          this privacy notice.
