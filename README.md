# [EveryThought](https://everythought.app) ‚òÅ

EveryThought is a web application designed to help you identify and recognize your emotions through daily guided prompts and journaling.

### Key Features

- Discover your emotions with our peaceful, guided prompts each day.
- Write a simple response to be saved in your recent thoughts.
- Prioritize your mental health by keeping track your Thoughts over time.

### How does it work?
Each time you create a new thought, you start a journey through a guided prompt. First, you'll be asked a thought-provoking question with an opportunity to respond. Then, as you continue through the steps of the thought, you'll learn about the associated emotion and how it relates to your life.

Whether you choose to create a new thought each day, week, or as many times as you desire; that's up to you.

### Getting Started

1. Go to [EveryThought.app](https://everythought.app) to sign up.
2. Complete your Profile.
3. Open **Start a new Thought** and follow the guided prompt.

### Supabase Hacktoberfest Hackathon 2021

This MVP was built in participation of [hacktoberfest](https://supabase.io/blog/2021/09/28/supabase-hacktoberfest-hackathon-2021). Supabase is _the_ open-source Firebase alternative. The development process was made easy by utilizing their supa-easy Javascript client. User authentication is handled by Supabase Auth. Storage is used to save user profile avatars and images used within the guided prompts. The postgres database hosts all user data and any content created by us. Users can service themselves completely within the app and handle sign up, data exporting to CSV, and account deletion.
